# README

Nothing to important to mention here I think. 
I used one controller with only one action since all I need was one page.

To update the page I used JS (more specifically, Stimulus.js, the "standard" way to do so in Rails 7).

I thought of including TailwindCSS but there were so few styles to use that I ended up just inlining them in the view!

Very far from great code, but oh well, was a decent experience, definitely fun!
